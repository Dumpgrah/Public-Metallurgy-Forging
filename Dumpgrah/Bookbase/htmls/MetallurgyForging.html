		<p style="text-align:left,font-family: Brush Script MT,cursive">This Guide explains how to Find ore, Smelt ore,Produce and cast ingots/bars/Nuggets and forging them into useful Tools/Weapons. perfect for your wannabe smith</p>

		<p><b>Geting Started</b></p>
		<p style="text-align:left">First you gonna need to find yourself a pickaxe, then you will need to find boulders around the area you are in, these boulders can be quite large and dont look like normal rocks, each one yields different ores so on. Each boulder has similar looks but slight differences in the look showing the veins, overtime you can learn to spot what boulder yields what ore from a distance.<br/>Once you have a pickaxe and know possible Ore Boulder locations, you need to find clay. this spawns in the local areas, just keep an eye out. once you got a clay package you can open it and make many recipes with it<br/><br/>Eighty Clay + 5 sticks = Crude Smelter<br/><br/>Twenty Clay + Full Plant Material = unfired bricks<br/><br/>One Hundred Fired Bricks + Eighty Clay = Improved Smelter or Forge<br/><br/>Forge + ?? Fired Bricks = Hooded Forge<br/><br/>Three Clay + 1/4th Plant Material = Nugget Mold<br/><br/>Ten Clay + Half Plant Material = Bar Mold<br/><br/>Twenty Five Clay + Full Plant Material = Ingot Mold<br/><br/>Sixty Clay + Full Plant Material = Anvil Mold<br/><br/>Twenty Clay + Bone Powder = Unfire Clay Crucible<br/><br/>Hammer + Ten Bones = FortyFive Bone Powder</p>

		<p style="text-align:left">First thing of clay items you should make is the Anvil mold & Crude Smelter & Get a Metal or Craft a Clay Crucible.Once you have these three things you need to find a Coal Boulder and Iron Boulder and mine them, You will need 10 coal Ore at least and some iron ore. Coal Ore can be cracked with a pickaxe or hammer. once you have two stacks of coal you can combine them to make stacked Coal, this is your fuel source for Smelters and forges, you can add coal to the stacked coal to refresh its quantity.<br/>Once you got a Smelter made and fueled, you just combine Iron Ore with Clay/Iron Crucible to fill it up once that is done, you can put the Iron filled Crucible into your smelter it will lock and the smelting will begin, after some time it will unlock and you will see a crucible of molten iron.(the material of iron varies) Once you got this you can pour the molten metal into the anvil mold. depending on your servers settings.once the Anvil mold is filled you need break the mold with a hammer to get your anvil(Steel anvils can be found in the economy and are the king of all anvils). once you got the anvil you will need to find a stump to put it on. do note not all trees give stumps so might take a while to find a stump bearing tree. after that you can repeat the smelting process to make ingots/bars/nuggets. You should make a ingot first, once done you can attach the ingot to the anvil to forge yourself a pair of tongs. after that you need to create a forge and add fuel to it as well. Once you have a forge made you can attach a piece of metal to heat it up. the tempatures to heat and work metal are defined by your server setting, but when the metal is hot enough to shape it will change to a glowing yellow texture, this is the time to move it to the anvil with your tongs and smith your item you wish, left click changes what to forge.The forging process takes X time and produces different results based on server setting. Cast Iron tool parts can be combined with sticks to make the tools,Impure/Pure Tools require Handles and Wedges.All Items craftable from metal<br/><br/>Ingot Recipes<br/>1.Cast Ingots make Hammer/Axe/Shovel heads.<br/>2.Impure/Pure Ingot makes Axe/Pickaxe/Hatchet/Shovel heads<br/><br/>Bar Recipes<br/>Impure/Pure bar make dagger parts<br/><br/>Nugget Recipes<br/>Cast/Impure/Pure make nails(Nuggets Consumed & Nails produced is a server setting)<br/>Impure/Pure make tool wedges<br/><br/><br/>Additionl recipes<br/>Building log + knife = Two long handles<br/>Firewood + knife = dagger/short handles<br/>Impure/Pure Iron tool heads require a Handle & Wedges. once you attach wedges to a handle you can combine them with a tool head to make the tool.</p>
